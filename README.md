Building An Accessible Sky remote with Arduino Mega


Sketchup Diagram: ![Alt](/Sketchup_Box/Box%20Diagram.jpg "Diagram")

This project builds a Sky Remote suitable for a user with limited fine motor controls (sutch as users with MS or other degenerative nerve conditions. It was conceived to help my father operate the  TV, once his fine movement left him unable to operate a standard (or even traditional 'accessible') remote.

This project uses an Arduino Mega processor, however any Arduino board compatible with the IRremote library and enough digital inputs for your buttons will suffice.  The mega is admittedly overkill for the functionality required. 

##Dependencies:

* An arduino board! - One supported by the IRremote library - see: [link](https://github.com/z3t0/Arduino-IRremote)
* Aformentioned library selected for your sketch. 
* Switches and a joystick, I recommend Arcade joysticks and switches as they have very definite actions, but require little force to actuate. They are also widely available. 
* An IR LED and appropriate current limiting resistor for it. You can desolder from an existing remote if you want, however I suggest you keep a working remote around for the equipment.
* Wires, Wiring tools and soldering equipment.  A lot of switches come with Spade connectors which may be more flexible to solder to than the switches directly.
* An appropriate enclosure, 
* A Step drill will be useful to drill holes in the enclosure for the switches and joystick.

##Appendix:

I have detailed the remote codes from the post linked above here in case this goes down. I've only implemented the ones I require in the header file, however it will be simple to add/remove as you need.
